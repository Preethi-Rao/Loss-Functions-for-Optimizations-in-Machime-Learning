# Loss Functions
Implemented the following Loss Functions in Python:
1. Logistic Loss
2. Hinge Loss
3. Least Square Loss
4. Simple Layer 2 Function

Additionally the gradient is calculated for each function.
This calculated gradient is compared to the numerical gradient.
Outputs show that they are similar.
